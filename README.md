sixNumbers
==========

So, there is this iPhone game called 6 Numbers that was free on the App Store not too long ago, where you have to 
solve a particular type of number puzzle.

For these puzzles, you are given 6 integers, which you need to add/subtract/multiply/divide together to reach a 
target number.

I got to thinking over lunch today that there should be a quick way to solve this computationally, so here is an 
early prototype solution.
